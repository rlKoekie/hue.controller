hue Controller
==============

This is a kodi plugin for basic control of Philips hue lights. It uses the phue (https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue) python module to do the actual work.
It has basic uPnP discovery to find the hue bridge in the network, based on the code from discoverhue (https://github.com/Overboard/discoverhue).

Supported platforms: So far the plugin has only been tested on Linux, but there is a good chance it works on OSX/Linux/Android as well :-)

Simple feature requests are welcome!
